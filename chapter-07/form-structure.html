<!-- The value of an action attribute is the URL for the page on the server that will reeive the information in the form when it is submitted. -->

<!-- Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post. -->

	<!-- With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. -->

	<!-- With the post method, the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers.-->
